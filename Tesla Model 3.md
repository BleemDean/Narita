## Tesla Model 3

### Safety Built for Safety

```
Safety is the most important part of the overall Model 3 design. The metal structure is a combination of aluminum and steel, for maximum strength in every area. In a roof-crush test, Model 3 resisted four times its own mass, even with an all-glass roof: that's the same weight as two full-grown African elephants.

### Performance Quickest Acceleration

```
Model 3 comes with the option of dual motor all-wheel drive, 20” Überturbine Wheels and Performance Brakes and lowered suspension for total control, in all weather conditions. And a carbon fiber spoiler improves stability at high speeds, all allowing Model 3 to accelerate from 0-60 mph* in as little as 3.1 seconds.
```

### All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor

```
Tesla All-Wheel Drive has two independent motors for improved redundancy, each with only one moving part for minimal maintenance and maximum durability. Unlike traditional all-wheel drive systems, they digitally control torque to the front and rear wheels for far better handling and traction control.
```

### Range Go Anywhere

```
Model 3 is fully electric, so you never need to visit a gas station again. If you charge overnight at home, you can wake up to a full battery every morning. And when you’re on the road, it’s easy to plug in along the way—at any public station or with the Tesla charging network. We currently have over 25,000 Superchargers worldwide, with six new locations opening every week.
```

### Autopilot Future of Driving

```
Autopilot's advanced safety and convenience features are designed to assist you with the most burdensome parts of driving.
```

### Interior Built Around the Driver

```
The inside of Model 3 is unlike any other car. You can use your smartphone as a key, and access all driver controls in the central 15-inch touchscreen. The all-glass roof extends from front to back, creating a sense of openness from every seat.
